# BookStore API

This is a simple RESTful API for managing books in a bookstore. The API is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository or create a new directory and add the provided code.

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install express mongoose
   ```

3. Update the MongoDB connection string in the code:
   Replace `<username>` and `<password>` in the following line with your MongoDB Atlas credentials:
   ```javascript
   mongoose.connect("mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.eowltwt.mongodb.net/BookStore")
   ```
   Alternatively, use your local MongoDB URI (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/BookStore`).

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

5. The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` by default.

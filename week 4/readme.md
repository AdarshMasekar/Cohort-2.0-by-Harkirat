## Detailed Breakdown

### 4.1 DOM, Dynamic Frontends, and Connecting Frontend to Backend

This section focuses on manipulating the DOM, creating dynamic frontends, and connecting them to backend APIs.

#### DOM (Document Object Model)

-   **Review**: The DOM represents the structure of an HTML document as a tree of objects, allowing JavaScript to interact with and modify web page content.
-   **Dynamic Updates**:
    -   Selecting elements using methods like `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, `querySelector`, and `querySelectorAll`.
    -   Modifying element content using `innerHTML` and `textContent`.
    -   Changing element attributes using `setAttribute` and `removeAttribute`.
    -   Adding and removing elements using `createElement`, `appendChild`, and `removeChild`.
    -   Handling events using `addEventListener`.
-   **Example**:
    -   An example is provided in the `readme.md` file demonstrating how to select an element by its ID and change its text content when a button is clicked.

#### Connecting Frontend to Backend

-   Making HTTP requests from the frontend to a backend API using `fetch` or `XMLHttpRequest`.
-   Sending data to the backend (e.g., form data) and receiving data from the backend (e.g., JSON responses).
-   Handling responses and updating the UI accordingly.
-   **Example**:
    -   A basic `fetch` request is shown in the `readme.md` file to get data from a backend API and log the response.

### 4.2 Chrome Developer Tools and Why Frontend Frameworks

This section covers the use of Chrome Developer Tools and the need for frontend frameworks.

#### Chrome Developer Tools

-   **Overview**: An essential suite of tools for frontend development.
-   **Key Features**:
    -   **Elements Panel**: Inspect and modify the DOM and CSS in real-time.
    -   **Console Panel**: Log messages, debug JavaScript, and execute code snippets.
    -   **Network Panel**: Monitor network requests and responses, analyze performance.
    -   **Sources Panel**: Debug JavaScript code, set breakpoints, and step through code.
    -   **Performance Panel**: Analyze page performance and identify bottlenecks.
-   **Debugging Techniques**:
    -   Using `console.log` for basic debugging.
    -   Setting breakpoints in the Sources panel.
    -   Stepping through code execution.
    -   Inspecting variables and call stacks.

#### Why Frontend Frameworks?

-   **Challenges of Vanilla JavaScript**:
    -   Managing complex UIs can become cumbersome.
    -   Code can become difficult to maintain and scale.
    -   Reactivity and state management can be challenging.
-   **Benefits of Frameworks**:
    -   **Component-Based Architecture**: Break down UIs into reusable components.
    -   **State Management**: Handle application state efficiently.
    -   **Reactivity**: Automatically update the UI when data changes.
    -   **Improved Developer Experience**: Provide tools and conventions for building complex applications.
    -   **Popular Frameworks**: Brief introduction to React, Angular, and Vue.js.

### Debouncing

-   **Concept**: Limiting the rate at which a function is executed, especially useful for handling rapidly firing events like `scroll`, `resize`, or `input`.
-   **Implementation**:
    -   Using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` to implement debouncing.
    -   Improving performance and reducing unnecessary function calls.
-   **Example**:
    -   A code example in `readme.md` demonstrates how to debounce an input event to avoid making too many API calls while a user is typing.

### Exercises

-   `week 4/exercises/Todo.html`: A basic HTML file for a todo application, likely used for practicing DOM manipulation.
    -   The file includes basic HTML structure and some CSS for styling the todo list.
    -   It sets up a basic layout for a todo application with a focus on dynamic updates.
